# lvm.telescope - Lazy Telescope Config

This is my telescope config derived from TJ Devries' setup. 

* see https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager/tree/master/xdg_config/nvim/lua/tj/telescope 

The idea of creating small modules which can be loaded in any Neovim has been taken from Evgeni Chasnovski's 
awesome [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/tree/main/lua/mini) libraries.


TODO:

[ ] Better default config
[ ] Integration with other Lvm modules
